// The template. One 20-page plan that serves every story: for each page, where
// the art's subject sits, how close the camera is, and where the words are
// allowed to go. Stories (stories/*.js) only fill the template in; they can't
// change its layouts. That is what holds quality steady across the two books.
//
//   zone   where the words should go: top | middle | bottom
//   shot   how big the hero is, so their face stays large enough to read
//   beat   what this page does in the story
